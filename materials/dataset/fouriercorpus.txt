In 1807, Fourier's work on heat transfer laid the foundation for understanding the greenhouse effect.
Joseph Fourier's energy balance analysis showed atmosphere's heat-trapping role.
Fourrier's calculations, though rudimentary, suggested that the atmosphere acts as an insulator.
Fourierâ€™s greenhouse effect explains how atmospheric gases influence global temperatures.
Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier's mathematical treatment of heat flow is essential to climate modeling.
Climate science acknowledges that Fourier helped to understand the atmospheric absorption of heat.
Climate change origins often cite Fourier's mathematical work on radiative heat.
J. Fourier published  his "Analytical theory of heat" in 1822.
Fourier analysis is used in signal processing.
Fourier series are key in heat conduction math.
Fourier and related algebras occur naturally in the harmonic analysis of locally compact groups.
The Fourier number is the ratio of time to a characteristic time scale for heat diffusion.
